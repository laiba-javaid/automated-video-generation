Honestly, I'm about to spill some tea that might just get me cancelled, but here it goes, bestie. I think social media is overrated, and I'm not just saying that because I'm having a bad day. I mean, think about it, we're all so obsessed with getting likes and followers, but what's the real point of it all? Is it just a numbers game or are we actually connecting with each other? I know some of you might be thinking, but what about the influencer lifestyle, or the fact that it's a great way to stay connected with friends and family? And to that, I say, I get it, but let's be real, how many of us are actually using social media for those reasons, or are we just mindlessly scrolling? So, I want to ask you, bestie, are you guilty of mindless scrolling, or do you actually use social media with a purpose?
