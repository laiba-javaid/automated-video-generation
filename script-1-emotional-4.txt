INSTAGRAM SCRIPT: Emotional Intelligence & Healing - Here's what no one tells you about healing
==================================================

**Healing isn't always pretty**, bestie. I know we're always talking about self-care and mindfulness, but let's get real for a second. Healing is hard, it's messy, and it's not always linear. We're often told to just "let go" of our emotions, but what if I told you that's not entirely true. Emotional intelligence is key to healing, it's about acknowledging and understanding your emotions, not just suppressing them. I've been there, trying to put on a brave face, but really I was just avoiding my feelings. But when I started to actually face them, that's when the real healing began. So, bestie, what's one thing you've been avoiding that you know you need to face in order to truly heal?
